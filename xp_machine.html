<p class="auto-style1">somewhere in the 2010's, powertrain industries removed 
every windows xp machine (including the one I got) and strangely replaced them 
with Macs. also, they killed most of the hard drives so they cant be accessed. 
but in 2022, they went back to windows (windows 10 computers of course). and in 
2023, they're parent company doorman got sold.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">there was only 4 computers that they had before they had 
windows 10 computers. only 3 of them were not being planned to be moved 
somewhere. and only 1 had full functionality.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">when powertrain industries went out of business, they 
were giving away everything to clear the space. I got one of the 2 computers. 
and I choose the second option because the first one had signs of hard drive 
failure.</p>
