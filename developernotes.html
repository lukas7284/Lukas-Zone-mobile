<p>I am getting pretty weird vibes, making this feel like a fever dream. Why? 
its currently 9:50 and I am at somebody's house with an internet radio that is 
playing Escapade from janet jackson (AKA a nonstalgic masterpeice). Anyways, 
this is the first build of Lukas Zone Mobile in its glory. Sometimes I wonder 
exactly why I am working on this in the first place. Noticed some visibility 
problems when testing it on the resolution of an i-phone 4s though.</p>
